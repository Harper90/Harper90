- 👋 Hi, I’m @Harper90
- AKA iridhollow
- 👀 I’m interested in way too many things at the moment
- 🌱 I’m currently ~~trying~~- to learn web app dev with the awesome creators of The Odin Project & attempting to teach myself to use graphic design apps like inkscape and krita
- I love art and being creative, I'm learning how to draw with charcoal, specifically photo realism. As well as using a graphics tablet, VEIKK A20.
- I started The Odin Project because I realized when trying to set up an ecommerce site for my new business endevour that I HATE pre planned themes and drag & drop web dev. I used to use HTML4, when I was a teenager to make stupid websites with no concepts. 
- Just started using Linux Ubuntu and I am In Love, So Many ways to troubleshoot problems and all from the bash terminal.
-  I'm pretty adapt at windows cmds, I learned mostly by bricking and un bricking many, many android devices.
-  I believe that I will really enjoy coding because of these last two things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...I have no idea!! I want to try Everything, so if when I get my act together with the Odin Project I will come back to this.
- 📫 How to reach me ... discord! @iridhollow, But I'm also a wife and a mother with ADHD, easily distracted and I suck at replying. Please dont feel bad or take it personally if it takes me forever to respond!
- Bye For Now!
